# If we ever switch to hosting, and more importantly building, on gh-pages, there are some differences to be aware of.
# Building using gh-pages would take quite a bit of work as they don't allow custom plugins, which we're currently using.
# Those are described at http:/jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/, but the code would look like such:

# require 'json'
# require 'open-uri'
# versions = JSON.parse(open('https://pages.github.com/versions.json').read)
# gem 'github-pages', versions['github-pages']

gem 'jekyll'
gem 'jekyll-redirect-from'
