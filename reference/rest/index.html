<h1>REST API</h1>

<p>The BBIS REST API provides access to several key components of data retrieval.  This API is commonly used in conjunction with the Advanced Donation Form.  The API defaults to returning JSON, but will also return XML based on the accept header.  See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/guide/">Developer Guide</a> for more information.</p>
